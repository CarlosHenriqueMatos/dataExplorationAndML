I will make normal predictions using Unet, UNet++ and Attention UNet in Amazon Forest, once completed, I will make a transfer learning and train again with Atlantic forest dataset to make a benchmark comparing the results with and without transfer learning and understanding the architecture contribution.

Code running until day 12/29 i will implement transfer learning.
