# Neural Networks works
The main goal of this repository is posts codes using neural networks in Kaggle competitions and others platforms, explain the code in an YouTube video.

As we known, classical algorithms achieve good results, especially when using a good feature engineering and model ensamble, but i want to work with neural networks, sometimes i can use classical algorithms for benchmark.

The first one code will be about titanic dataset, almost everybody begin using it and i will too.
Without high goals, just for fun and knowledge.
